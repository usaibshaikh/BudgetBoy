## Developer Information

**App Name:** BudgetBoy  
**Developer:** Mohammad Usaib  
**Platform:** Android  
**Contact:** GitHub - https://github.com/usaibshaikh

## Data Collection and Storage

### What Data We Collect

BudgetBoy collects and stores only the following information that you explicitly provide:

- Expense descriptions (text input provided by you)
- Expense amounts (numerical values you enter)
- Expense categories (selected from predefined options: Personal Expenses, Phone Recharge, Home Expenses, Other)
- Date and timestamp of when you create each expense record

### How We Store Your Data

**Local Storage Only:** All your data is stored exclusively on your device's local file storage system in a hidden directory. BudgetBoy does NOT:

- Upload any data to cloud servers
- Transmit data over the internet
- Store data on external servers
- Share data with third parties
- Collect any personal identification information
- Access your contacts, location, or other personal data

### No Internet Required

BudgetBoy operates completely offline and does not require an internet connection to function. The app does not communicate with any external servers or services.

## Data Sharing

### User-Initiated Sharing Only

Your expense data remains private and is never automatically shared. The only way data leaves your device is when YOU explicitly choose to:

1. **Export Function:** Export your expense records to your device's download folder
2. **Share Function:** Share expense details through third-party apps (such as WhatsApp) that you select

These actions are entirely voluntary and initiated by you. We do not have access to or control over any data you choose to share through these functions.

## Data Security

- All data is stored locally on your device in a hidden directory
- Data security depends on your device's security measures (screen lock, encryption, etc.)
- We recommend keeping your device secure with appropriate passwords/biometric locks
- If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be removed from your device

## Data Deletion

You have complete control over your data:

- **Individual Deletion:** Long-press any expense item to delete it after confirmation
- **Complete Deletion:** Uninstalling the app removes all stored data from your device
- There is no data recovery option since no backups are created outside your device

## Third-Party Services

BudgetBoy does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks. The app is completely ad-free and does not use any tracking mechanisms.

## Children's Privacy

BudgetBoy does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app is designed for general expense tracking and can be used by anyone capable of managing their expenses.

## Permissions

BudgetBoy only requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:

- **Storage Permission:** Required to read and write expense data to local storage and to export/share expense reports

The app does not request or use:
- Internet/Network permissions
- Location permissions
- Camera permissions
- Contact permissions
- Any other invasive permissions

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

As an independently developed app, any changes to this Privacy Policy will be reflected in app updates. The updated policy will be made available through the app listing on Google Play Store. Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over:

- What data you enter
- When you delete data
- Whether you export or share data
- Complete removal of all data by uninstalling the app
